**Benefits**

This project has enhanced my overall understanding of React and expanded my knowledge of hooks, such as useRef. Additionally, I was able to utilize Firebase and integrate it into my project as both a database and a user authentication method.

**Features**

This website is a clone of the famous game "Where's Waldo." The objective is to locate the 3 requested Pokémon (since the site was created using the Pokémon API and developed with a Pokémon theme) in the shortest amount of time possible. Once you have identified them, you can choose to either play anonymously or enter your username.

The following technologies were used to build this app:

**HTML<br>
CSS<br>
